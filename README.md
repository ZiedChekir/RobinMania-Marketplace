# Introduction

This project is an NFT marketplace for the RobinMania game that features an auction and trading platform for users to securely connect their wallets and trade assets through our smart contract deployed on the Polygon network. Utilizing ReactJS for the frontend, Solidity for smart contract development, and Hardhat for contract deployment and testing, this project secured first place in the Encode Club Hackathon and was highlighted in the article [Encode X Polygon Hackathon Finale: Prizewinners and Summary](https://medium.com/encode-club/encode-x-polygon-hackathon-finale-prizewinners-and-summary-482a19848535) on Medium.
